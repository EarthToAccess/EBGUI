# The Command Box

EBGui's main functionality comes from its Command Box, shown below;

<p align=center><a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/VY9cvzK/EBGui-Command-Box.png" alt="EBGui-Command-Box" border="0"></a></p>

It's in this box that the main meat of EBGui's potential can be provided to you, from modifying how certain features work, to enabling/disabling other features. Anything you need to do, you start with the Command Box.

The Command Box isn't just for running commands, though (see [The Commands](/Docs.md#The_commands))! The Command Box is also how you pick your targets. Simply type the name of your opponent and press Enter -- and you don't even need the full name![^1] You can de-select someone by typing your own name.

The text below the input box itself ("Welcome to EBGui!" in the image) is the output text. On its own, it will display a welcome message on load, and the current target past that (e.g. "Current Target | (None)" if nobody's selected, or "Current Target | username" if someone is).

When you type a command into the input box, that text will also change to give you the response from that command, be it an error, success, or information. Some commands' info might not fit that text spot, though, so always check the console if something went wrong!

# The Main Menu

Need to hit a Blaze Column well, or maybe send yourself across the map with Long Flash? Use the Main Menu to toggle EBGui's main options and turn on some other exploits!

<p align=center><a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/XDbDfWJ/EBGui-Main.png" alt="EBGui-Main" border="0"></a><br /><a target='_blank' href='https://imgbb.com/'>upload image</a><br /></p>

The Main Menu is split in categories, starting at the topmost with Area of Effect moves. Features with "Hack" in the name can be done from anywhere on the map and will spawn at the target's location. "Instant" features will fire immediately at the location of the target, but only if you're within the normal range of the move hitting.

In the image given above, we'll make an example of "Splitting Slime Hack" and "Instant Blaze Column". The former can be fired at the arena area, and appear on someone on top of the mountain. You can even use these moves from many, MANY studs away from the map entirely. The latter, however, must be used within the proper range of the opponent, as if you were going to use it normally. Only then will it fire.

## The C Key

Most move exploits are done by pressing C while they're enabled. For the most part, anything involving specific moves (e.g. "Instant Blaze Column" etc.) will use this key.

Exploits that don't use the C key will have the key they correspond to labeled with them. If a keybind isn't working, ensure it's not a toggle button.

## Golden Moves

Some features and exploits require [EBGui Gold](/Docs.md#About_Gold) to use. These features are labeled with a "(G)" next to the name; for example, in the image above, "Instant Chain Hack" is prefixed with the "(G)", meaning only Gold members can use it. Attempting to enable it while not a Gold member will just give you an error.

## SmartAttack

EBGui SmartAttack prevents most C-key exploits from firing if your target is in safezone. Wasted mana and cooldowns are no fun, so we've made it easier for you to trigger your exploits without missing your mark![^2] You can disable it with `;smartattack` (see [The Commands](/Docs.md#The_Commands)).

And most importantly,

## YOU!

Thank you for supporting EBGui in its official release!

[^1]: While the Command Box does support names in substrings (e.g. "earth" vs. "EarthToAccess"), it will throw an error if more than one person with that substring is in the server. For example, typing "kind" when "Kindnessx03" and "kinderegg_" both exist in the server will not choose either of them.

[^2]: SmartAttack will not change the current target to a different person if in any [target setting](/Docs.md#targetsetting) other than `select`. You will not be able to use C-key exploits if your target continually meets the given mode's criteria; alternatively, if another player meets said mode's criteria, your target will change. SmartAttack will not target yourself, and to disable targeting entirely, you will need to switch your target setting back to `select`, then select yourself.
